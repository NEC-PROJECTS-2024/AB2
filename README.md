# INTRODUCTION:
Road safety remains a critical concern for 
governmental authorities, necessitating proactive measures 
to address the persisting issue of traffic accidents despite 
advancements in vehicle safety features. Understanding the 
root causes of accidents is pivotal for devising effective 
preventive strategies. Hence, urgent attention is warranted 
to analyse accident frequency, encompassing factors like 
current road conditions and environmental variables, to 
inform mitigation efforts.In pursuit of a robust accident prediction framework, I 
employed machine learning techniques including Decision 
Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression algorithms. 
The adoption of these methodologies holds significant 
potential in enhancing safety protocols and facilitating 
accident prognosis. Factors such as weather conditions, 
vehicle condition, road surface quality, and lighting 
conditions are pivotal in predicting accident occurrences. By 
leveraging comprehensive datasets encompassing accident, 
casualty, and vehicle information, accurate predictions 
regarding accident severity can be achieved
